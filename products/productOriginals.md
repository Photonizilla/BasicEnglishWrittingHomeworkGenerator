## Week 11

### Day 1
Instead of `condemning` scientism by definition, opponents need to show what is wrong with it.

Still, it’s rational to live in hope that humans will rise to the challenge, and to find meaning and motivation in that hope. `Likewise`, I believe it’s rational to live in hope that a better universe is possible.

Those statements are `jointly` inconsistent; they can’t all be true together.

### Day 2
The scope of science has both narrowed and broadened, depending on the time and place and culture contexts where it was `practiced`.

If we `take` evolutionary biology `seriously`, then we certainly should reject any essentialist conception of it.

 Add the wrong `ingredients` into the Big Data recipe, and what you’ll get is a potentially `toxic` output.

### Day 3
Bereaved individuals `experiencing complications` in their grief process often describe their situation as extremely `numbing`, overwhelming and `debilitating`.

Examining how deep disagreements arise will demonstrate the `gravity` of the issue.

They consider that a wise man should always remain calm, and though they have their passionate moments (being in fact a very `excitable` race), they do not wish to perpetuate them in art, because they think ill of them.

### Day 4
Touch does not always make us `experience things better`, but it certainly makes us `feel better` about what we experience.

In short, we are rehearsing the idea that moral qualities belong to categories of people rather than individuals.

Instead of `engaging in` deliberation about oneself, what the arts of mindfulness have in common is a certain mode of `attending to` present events.

### Day 5
But it is not only our own self-preservation that is `at stake` here.

If learning and thinking were as easy as deciding to let `nothing but the facts` in, we would never make mistakes.

The survival of the West depends on Americans reaffirming their Western identity and Westerners accepting their civilization as unique not universal and uniting to renew and preserve it against challenges from non-Western societies. Avoidance of a global war of civilizations depends on world leaders accepting and cooperating to maintain the multicivilizational character of global politics.

### Day 6
But despite the efforts of these and many other philosophers, "love" remains a notoriously ambiguous concept.

The `progressive tendency` of the general rate of profit to fall is, therefore, just an expression peculiar to the capitalist mode of production of the progressive development of the social productivity of labour. This does not `mean to say` that the rate of profit may not fall temporarily for other reasons.

A conservative tradition `equips` those who rely on what is handed down with false views about a subject.

## Week 12

### Day 1
A desire for immortality is thus a paradox: it would frustrate itself `were it` ever to be achieved.

`It is well established that` people sometimes think they have beliefs that they don’t really have.

While rarely looked at together today, experiences of psychedelics and psychosis `share` a lot of subjective `territory`.

### Day 2
History no longer seemed static and determined, and the belief that humans could make things better through their own unaided efforts meant that there was no longer a need to appeal to Providence for help.

`Less discussed is` the historic shift that altered the nature of so many of our modern retellings of folklore.

Hiding a gaping contradiction between what we like and what we do takes significant `mental effort` and this leaves little energy to do anything else.

### Day 3
Accepting that others are vital to our self-perception is `a corrective to` the limitations of the Cartesian view.

`The same goes for` other common sources of justification, like other peoples’ testimony or our own senses.

The beauty of the method was that it required no effort. `By effort, I mean` that dubious concept of willpower.

### Day 4
Facebook's launch of the Metaverse has been critiqued as a fluke that aimed `to distract from` the company's legal `troubles`.

There is nothing in the idea of final causes to `encourage` such wishful thinking.

I `started my professional life trying to be` a concert pianist, `back in the days of` the Cold War.

### Day 5
Armed with a hypothesis, we `bend reality around it`, `clinging to our opinions` even in the face of evidence to the contrary.

Humans have an `instinctive aversion` to the possibility of being wrong.

Crucially, moments of solitude permit us to see into the nature of things almost `as if for the first time`.

### Day 6
Many other `alleged` instances of science-religion conflict have now `been exposed as` pure inventions.

The technological challenges to obtaining meaningful results from fragmentary and `often contaminated` evidence took years to overcome.

For they used to suppose that they trained people `by imparting to them not the art but its products`, as though anyone professing that he would impart a form of knowledge to obviate any pain in the feet were then not to teach a man the art of shoe-making … but were to `present him with` several kinds of shoes of all sorts.

## Week 13

### Day 1
We `generally` `pardon` wrongdoers if their offence was accidental as opposed to intentional.

We know from everyday experience that a person is partly `forged in the crucible of` community.

We cannot, it seems, both fully respect others, regard them as intelligent and sincere, and still be fully convinced that we are right and they are completely wrong, unless we simply `agree to disagree`.

### Day 2
Yet there seems to be `growing interest`, especially among millennials, in rediscovering the benefits of simple living.

Like all forms of self-improvement, breaking this carapace requires intention, and ideally guidance.

We want to help them unlock themselves, `stand taller, think better`.

### Day 3
It’s pointless having a group of smart people around a table if all they do is nod along with each other. (Impressive!)

This simplicity and accessibility `ensure` that Stoicism will never be properly `embraced by` those who prefer the abstracted and esoteric in their philosophies.

Our understandings of terms sometimes `outpace` our definitions of them and, when that happens, offering definitions can `muddy the waters`.

### Day 4
Most of us can recall a friend who once met certain of our core social needs, but who eventually – gradually, `perhaps even` imperceptibly – ultimately failed to `do so`.

`Rather than` `grounding` cosmic purpose in the desires of a creator, perhaps there just is a natural tendency `towards` life inherent in the universe, one that interacts with the more familiar laws of physics in ways we don’t yet understand.

In short, a working knowledge of the way in which causes and effects relate to one another `seems indispensible to` our ability to make our way in the world.

### Day 5
Their worldview can survive exposure to those outside voices because their belief system has `prepared them for` such intellectual onslaught.

An annular eclipse treated parts of the United States, Central America and South America to a "ring of fire".

`To paint with a very broad brush`, we can observe two basic linguistic regimes in Western science.

### Day 6
We must `stand back`, and abstract from the very things we usually find `of most interest`.

`Yet` the stories of these two men, vastly separated in place and time, are not merely stories of a cold and rapacious science.

The concept of implicit bias has `captivated` social psychologists for decades.

## Week 14

### Day 1
"Capitalism" was Weber’s own word and he defined it `as he saw fit`.

But there are two very different phenomena `at play` here, each of which subvert the flow of information `in very distinct ways`.

It’s `fair to say`, `strange as it sounds`, that Williams’s defence of truth and truthfulness was an `unfashionable` undertaking in the humanities at the time.

### Day 2
The experimental design of memory testing, for example, tends to `proceed from` the assumption that it’s possible to `draw a sharp distinction` between the self and the world.

A far wiser move `would be` to accept the distorted reality of finance.

Individual stories might show the virtues of honesty or hospitality, but there’s no agreement among folktales about which actions are good or bad.

### Day 3
It doesn’t `deliver to` me a sufficiently broad and representative coverage of all the relevant information.

I glance around to `gauge` the others’ reactions, but their inscrutable faces bearing no mark of change.

Rarely do we `display` much intellectual curiosity about what these practices of withdrawal might be doing for us.

### Day 4
My interest in him `accelerated with the appearance of` the Academy Award-winning film Amadeus (1984).

He `recommended that` the men `be` allowed to be honest about their anger, and `process it openly`, without shame.

I certainly `do not wish to` deny that it’s possible for photographs to be morally disrespectful.

### Day 5
But if we `take a step back`, we might think that this business is a bit strange.

They `pointed` to the need for further study, which the five tribes strenuously opposed, calling for the bones to be buried without further analysis.

They seek `a glowing image of` admiration and gratitude, `deified` in the depths of a woman’s two eyes.

### Day 6
`Given all the foregoing`, it is difficult to `escape the conclusion` that all lives contain more bad than good, and that they are deprived of more good than they contain. 

A show might not be bad enough to leave, but would you have come at all if you knew how bad it would be? (An excellent metaphor!)

As people become accustomed to getting immediate answers, they do less `digging for information` themselves.

## Week 15

### Day 1
`We often talk about` what very young children know, even before they learn to talk, and we say that our fellow creatures know things too.

Humean humans are therefore creatures `of flesh and blood, of intellect and instinct, of reason and passion`.

Belief in supernatural powers `is doomed to` die out, all over the world, as a result of the increasing adequacy and diffusion of scientific knowledge.

### Day 2
In fact, we have `quite as much` to learn from them as they from us, but there is `far less chance of` our learning it.

The distinction between the typical and the `more problematic version` of grief can be illustrated through an analogy.

How `singular` is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be thought to be the opposite of it; for they never come to a man together, and yet he who pursues either of them is `generally compelled to take` the other.

### Day 3
He would have pointed out that a capacity for hard work was something that did not dist­inguish the modern West from previous soc­ieties and their value systems.

Even when implicit bias is conscious, it is `notoriously hard` to change.

Yet familiarity doesn’t `account for` the whole phenomenon.

### Day 4
That might insulate them against the horror, but they should nonetheless know that `every birth is a death in waiting`.

Those with a strong need for their uniqueness to be recognised may be more `disposed to` loneliness.

Increasing regulatory pressures mean that psychedelic research may not be able to `hold on to` these `expansive` and complex ways of thinking about psychedelic experiences.

### Day 5
The problem is `the tendency to` `present` mindfulness `as` a panacea for all manner of modern ills.

An even bigger problem is the way that technology damages critical-thinking skills. 

Indeed, such is the generosity of active listening that one can view the practice as one that borders on the spiritual.

### Day 6
Psychological fullness is a feeling of sufficiency that `comes from` a much more complex computation.

Of course, the harsh reality is that death comes either "too early or too late".

Still we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is `error upon error, and clout upon clout`, and our best virtue has for its occasion a `superfluous and evitable wretchedness`.

## Week 16

### Day 1
`Brains learn from other brains`, and listening well is the simplest way to `draw a thread`, `open a channel`.

If we change while our self-image remains the same, then there will be a deep abyss between who we are and who we think we are.

When old friends to whom we remain committed fail to meet our new needs, it’s helpful to ask how to salvage the situation.

### Day 2
It may seem difficult to explain a way of thinking that `strikes` one as so obviously correct.

The existence of something like a human nature that separates us from the rest of the animal world has often been `implied`, and sometimes `explicitly stated`, throughout the history of philosophy.

The argument has `raged` for more than a century now, with new arguments `being made` on both sides.

### Day 3
When battles over moral relativism have featured in the culture wars, they `tend to` be framed in the following way.

Philosophy has always been quietly at work in the background of science.

You would look `askance` at someone who said that it’s going to snow tomorrow but then claimed that there was no explanation for that.

### Day 4
Such a conclusion will not `come as a surprise` to philosophers who have considered the issue.

It was one of the `key ingredients` in making another person feel less alone, less stuck, and more capable of self-insight.

`The emphasis`, in other words, `in` progressive tradition is not on the contents inherited and passed on, but on their development.

### Day 5
To understand how this can be achieved, we need to remember something that Socrates `drew our attention to` long ago.

`One might be tempted to` suggest Goldin’s work provides an example of how our selves can be constructed in a narrative fashion through portraits.

But I was not certain of this, as the dream might have meant music in the popular sense of the word, and being under sentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite, I thought that I should be safer if I satisfied the scruple, and, in obedience to the dream, composed a few verses before I departed.

### Day 6
The way in which it relates to Buddhism, particularly its meditation practices, is `an ongoing area of` controversy.

Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is `pebbly with stars`. I cannot count one.

Global politics began to be reconfigured along cultural lines. Upside-down flags were a sign of the transition, but more and more the flags are flying `high and true`, and Russians and other peoples are mobilizing and marching behind these and other symbols of their new cultural identities.
