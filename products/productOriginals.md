## Week 1

### Day 1
We cannot, it seems, both fully respect others, regard them as intelligent and sincere, and still be fully convinced that we are right and they are completely wrong, unless we simply `agree to disagree`.

The answers that emerge will be stronger for `having been forged in the crucible of` our disagreement

Most philosophers of mind would agree, `holding that` we have privileged access to our own thoughts, which is largely immune from error.

### Day 2
That might `be about to` change, `under the influence of` two factors: economics and environmentalism.

It’s pointless having a group of smart people around a table if all they do is nod along with each other. (Impressive!)

We `do ourselves an immense favour` `when` we consider adversity an opportunity to make this discovery.

### Day 3
Crucially, moments of solitude permit us to see into the nature of things almost `as if for the first time`.

Yet familiarity doesn’t `account for` the whole phenomenon.

A conservative tradition `equips` those who rely on what is handed down with false views about a subject.

### Day 4
`Rather than` `grounding` cosmic purpose in the desires of a creator, perhaps there just is a natural tendency `towards` life inherent in the universe, one that interacts with the more familiar laws of physics in ways we don’t yet understand.

An annular eclipse treated parts of the United States, Central America and South America to a "ring of fire".

The problem is not only that different groups disagree, but that there seems `no way to resolve` these disagreements `without` bloodshed.

### Day 5
A second condition is that the debate should be allowed to `become passionate without becoming a shouting match`.

The way in which it relates to Buddhism, particularly its meditation practices, is `an ongoing area of` controversy.

`At first glance`, it might seem that human nature plays a far more crucial role in Stoicism than in existentialism.

### Day 6
But `the years since` have led to a remarkable divide between our understandings of these phenomena.

Armed with a hypothesis, we `bend reality around it`, `clinging to our opinions` even in the face of evidence to the contrary.

It is better to `make a beginning of` a thing which has a chance of an end, than to get caught up in things which have no end.

## Week 2

### Day 1
It is striking how useful his invention proves in the context of Buddhist metaphysics, though Buddhism `played no part in` inspiring it.

That’s because, whenever you deliberate, you have already `ruled out` all kinds of unthinkable possibilities.

Of course, the harsh reality is that death comes either "too early or too late".

### Day 2
We want to help them unlock themselves, `stand taller, think better`.

Like all forms of self-improvement, breaking this carapace requires intention, and ideally guidance.

`Brains learn from other brains`, and listening well is the simplest way to `draw a thread`, `open a channel`.

### Day 3
letting ourselves `become hosts to` these false beliefs is morally wrong because, as we have seen, the error cost for society `can be` devastating.

I think the debates that tend to get called ‘normative ethical’ are a lot like this.

We believe the time has come for scholars across the fields to reorient their work around the `question` of "ends".

### Day 4
A far wiser move `would be` to accept the distorted reality of finance.

A `flourishing` branch of logic is computational complexity theory.

Belief in supernatural powers `is doomed to` die out, all over the world, as a result of the increasing adequacy and diffusion of scientific knowledge.

### Day 5
Accepting that others are vital to our self-perception is `a corrective to` the limitations of the Cartesian view.

He `recommended that` the men `be` allowed to be honest about their anger, and `process it openly`, without shame.

An even bigger problem is the way that technology damages critical-thinking skills. 

### Day 6
As a culture, we treat listening as an automatic process about which there is not a lot to say.

 Add the wrong `ingredients` into the Big Data recipe, and what you’ll get is a potentially `toxic` output.

A show might not be bad enough to leave, but would you have come at all if you knew how bad it would be? (An excellent metaphor!)

## Week 3

### Day 1
I `started my professional life trying to be` a concert pianist, `back in the days of` the Cold War.

`One might be tempted to` suggest Goldin’s work provides an example of how our selves can be constructed in a narrative fashion through portraits.

`The same goes for` other common sources of justification, like other peoples’ testimony or our own senses.

### Day 2
Those with a strong need for their uniqueness to be recognised may be more `disposed to` loneliness.

The technological challenges to obtaining meaningful results from fragmentary and `often contaminated` evidence took years to overcome.

Such a conclusion will not `come as a surprise` to philosophers who have considered the issue.

### Day 3
The argument has `raged` for more than a century now, with new arguments `being made` on both sides.

Individual stories might show the virtues of honesty or hospitality, but there’s no agreement among folktales about which actions are good or bad.

I glance around to `gauge` the others’ reactions, but their inscrutable faces bearing no mark of change.

### Day 4
`Less discussed is` the historic shift that altered the nature of so many of our modern retellings of folklore.

But if we `take a step back`, we might think that this business is a bit strange.

This simplicity and accessibility `ensure` that Stoicism will never be properly `embraced by` those who prefer the abstracted and esoteric in their philosophies.

### Day 5
That this perspective doesn’t `seem particularly radical` today is `a testament to` Rogers’s legacy.

The part `most responsible for` regulating hunger and other basic motivated states is called the hypothalamus.

Open and wholehearted argument can raise the collective intelligence of a group, but `the chemistry of` a disagreement is inherently unstable.

### Day 6
`We often talk about` what very young children know, even before they learn to talk, and we say that our fellow creatures know things too.

The existence of something like a human nature that separates us from the rest of the animal world has often been `implied`, and sometimes `explicitly stated`, throughout the history of philosophy.

Bereaved individuals `experiencing complications` in their grief process often describe their situation as extremely `numbing`, overwhelming and `debilitating`.

## Week 4

### Day 1
If you know thyself to be `such-and-such` a kind of person, this limits your freedom considerably.

`Leaving aside any lingering fondness for` quaint 19th-century understandings of history, we must look to the fear of Islamic fundamentalism.

You would look `askance` at someone who said that it’s going to snow tomorrow but then claimed that there was no explanation for that.

### Day 2
Philosophy has always been quietly at work in the background of science.

We must `stand back`, and abstract from the very things we usually find `of most interest`.

Even when implicit bias is conscious, it is `notoriously hard` to change.

### Day 3
If learning and thinking were as easy as deciding to let `nothing but the facts` in, we would never make mistakes.

Increasing regulatory pressures mean that psychedelic research may not be able to `hold on to` these `expansive` and complex ways of thinking about psychedelic experiences.

But early beliefs lead to all sorts of other beliefs, and any early falsehoods he’d accepted had surely infected the rest of his belief system.

### Day 4
Many other `alleged` instances of science-religion conflict have now `been exposed as` pure inventions.

Also, because ambivalent friendships make you `feel uncertain about where you stand`, they can push you to work harder to `establish your position`.

When old friends to whom we remain committed fail to meet our new needs, it’s helpful to ask how to salvage the situation.

### Day 5
The beauty of the method was that it required no effort. `By effort, I mean` that dubious concept of willpower.

The world is `overstuffed with` information, and one can’t `sort through it all` by oneself.

Our understandings of terms sometimes `outpace` our definitions of them and, when that happens, offering definitions can `muddy the waters`.

### Day 6
Poetry stretches words until and so that we are forced to look afresh at them. (Interesting!)

It `leads us naturally to ask` just what it was that was thrown at them.

To understand how this can be achieved, we need to remember something that Socrates `drew our attention to` long ago.

## Week 5

### Day 1
Instead of `condemning` scientism by definition, opponents need to show what is wrong with it.

The reasons why this is so are precisely the reasons why it ought not to be. (Elegant!)

If we `take` evolutionary biology `seriously`, then we certainly should reject any essentialist conception of it.

### Day 2
Examining how deep disagreements arise will demonstrate the `gravity` of the issue.

The problem is `the tendency to` `present` mindfulness `as` a panacea for all manner of modern ills.

`It is well established that` people sometimes think they have beliefs that they don’t really have.

### Day 3
As much as we need to take responsibility for being better friends and for our part in relationship conflict and break-ups, quite a few factors `surrounding` friendship are out of our control.

Once they notice this, the idea that it can be appropriate to ask questions about objectivity in science ceases to be strange.

There is nothing in the idea of final causes to `encourage` such wishful thinking.

### Day 4
But there are two very different phenomena `at play` here, each of which subvert the flow of information `in very distinct ways`.

My interest in him `accelerated with the appearance of` the Academy Award-winning film Amadeus (1984).

Those statements are `jointly` inconsistent; they can’t all be true together.

### Day 5
As people become accustomed to getting immediate answers, they do less `digging for information` themselves.

We know from everyday experience that a person is partly `forged in the crucible of` community.

Touch does not always make us `experience things better`, but it certainly makes us `feel better` about what we experience.

### Day 6
Rarely do we `display` much intellectual curiosity about what these practices of withdrawal might be doing for us.

It is to `attack` the echo chamber `at its root` and repair that broken trust.

Bad listening `signals` to the people around you that you don’t care about them.

## Week 6

### Day 1
The distinction between the typical and the `more problematic version` of grief can be illustrated through an analogy.

Yet there seems to be `growing interest`, especially among millennials, in rediscovering the benefits of simple living.

We `generally` `pardon` wrongdoers if their offence was accidental as opposed to intentional.

### Day 2
It was one of the `key ingredients` in making another person feel less alone, less stuck, and more capable of self-insight.

In short, we are rehearsing the idea that moral qualities belong to categories of people rather than individuals.

They seek `a glowing image of` admiration and gratitude, `deified` in the depths of a woman’s two eyes.

### Day 3
"Capitalism" was Weber’s own word and he defined it `as he saw fit`.

It doesn’t `deliver to` me a sufficiently broad and representative coverage of all the relevant information.

Wealth provided security, but even for the rich wealth was `flimsy protection against` misfortunes such as war, famine, disease, injustice and the disfavour of tyrants.

### Day 4
Humans have an `instinctive aversion` to the possibility of being wrong.

Most of us can recall a friend who once met certain of our core social needs, but who eventually – gradually, `perhaps even` imperceptibly – ultimately failed to `do so`.

For they used to suppose that they trained people `by imparting to them not the art but its products`, as though anyone professing that he would impart a form of knowledge to obviate any pain in the feet were then not to teach a man the art of shoe-making … but were to `present him with` several kinds of shoes of all sorts.

### Day 5
Hiding a gaping contradiction between what we like and what we do takes significant `mental effort` and this leaves little energy to do anything else.

Differences in the design of the two studies might `limit the extent to which` we can compare their findings.

The scope of science has both narrowed and broadened, depending on the time and place and culture contexts where it was `practiced`.

### Day 6
The concept of implicit bias has `captivated` social psychologists for decades.

But despite the efforts of these and many other philosophers, "love" remains a notoriously ambiguous concept.

Maybe our limited designer feels awful about how messy such a process inevitably is, but `it was that or nothing`.

## Week 7

### Day 1
`The emphasis`, in other words, `in` progressive tradition is not on the contents inherited and passed on, but on their development.

I certainly `do not wish to` deny that it’s possible for photographs to be morally disrespectful.

`To paint with a very broad brush`, we can observe two basic linguistic regimes in Western science.

### Day 2
They `pointed` to the need for further study, which the five tribes strenuously opposed, calling for the bones to be buried without further analysis.

Because just as my religion seems true to me, so does another’s religion seem true to them.

It may seem difficult to explain a way of thinking that `strikes` one as so obviously correct.

### Day 3
It’s important to `note that` diversity of belief doesn’t `by itself` entail relativism. 

History no longer seemed static and determined, and the belief that humans could make things better through their own unaided efforts meant that there was no longer a need to appeal to Providence for help.

Indeed, such is the generosity of active listening that one can view the practice as one that borders on the spiritual.

### Day 4
In short, a working knowledge of the way in which causes and effects relate to one another `seems indispensible to` our ability to make our way in the world.

Some of our most worrying societal disagreements `are` deep disagreements, `or at least they share certain features of` deep disagreements.

No longer did scientists think `in terms of` organisms: they thought in terms of machines.

### Day 5
The experimental design of memory testing, for example, tends to `proceed from` the assumption that it’s possible to `draw a sharp distinction` between the self and the world.

The proliferation of knowledge and reflection on knowledge had `made it impossible for` any one person to know and survey it all.

Psychological fullness is a feeling of sufficiency that `comes from` a much more complex computation.

### Day 6
Facebook's launch of the Metaverse has been critiqued as a fluke that aimed `to distract from` the company's legal `troubles`.

It’s `fair to say`, `strange as it sounds`, that Williams’s defence of truth and truthfulness was an `unfashionable` undertaking in the humanities at the time.

Instead of `engaging in` deliberation about oneself, what the arts of mindfulness have in common is a certain mode of `attending to` present events.

## Week 8

### Day 1
The `literature` on sense of belonging is clear on the benefits to workers.

Still, it’s rational to live in hope that humans will rise to the challenge, and to find meaning and motivation in that hope. `Likewise`, I believe it’s rational to live in hope that a better universe is possible.

That might insulate them against the horror, but they should nonetheless know that `every birth is a death in waiting`.

### Day 2
One would be hard pressed to find a non-scientific theory that is as explanatorily, instrumentally and predictively successful as the theory of relativity.

But it is not only our own self-preservation that is `at stake` here.

Humean humans are therefore creatures `of flesh and blood, of intellect and instinct, of reason and passion`.

### Day 3
He would have pointed out that a capacity for hard work was something that did not dist­inguish the modern West from previous soc­ieties and their value systems.

`Given all the foregoing`, it is difficult to `escape the conclusion` that all lives contain more bad than good, and that they are deprived of more good than they contain. 

`Yet` the stories of these two men, vastly separated in place and time, are not merely stories of a cold and rapacious science.

### Day 4
If we change while our self-image remains the same, then there will be a deep abyss between who we are and who we think we are.

It’s often said that a successful picture "captures the essence" of a subject. But a great photograph `does so much more`.

The strategies that `got` us this far may not be the ones we need to move forward.

### Day 5
The conscious events we `undergo` are all sensory states `of some kind`, and what we `take to be` conscious thoughts and decisions are really sensory images.

While rarely looked at together today, experiences of psychedelics and psychosis `share` a lot of subjective `territory`.

Their worldview can survive exposure to those outside voices because their belief system has `prepared them for` such intellectual onslaught.

### Day 6
While the students `wrestled with` these metaphysical issues, they also had more mundane concerns.

When battles over moral relativism have featured in the culture wars, they `tend to` be framed in the following way.

A desire for immortality is thus a paradox: it would frustrate itself `were it` ever to be achieved.
